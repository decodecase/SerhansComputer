Subject: I was wrong.

Melis,

I know you didn’t want to hear from me. I promised I would respect your silence, but I broke that promise — in more ways than one.

I read it. Your journal.

I told myself it was for closure, to understand the distance. But that’s not true. I read it because I missed you. Because it felt like the only way left to speak to you without you running.

Page by page, I could feel you slipping away. But somewhere between the entries I thought… maybe I could still fix it. Even if it wasn’t mine to fix.

You wrote that I see people as compositions. I suppose I do. But you were never a piece to be perfected. You were the only thing I could never finish.

You don’t have to forgive me. I just wanted you to know that I saw you. In every note, in every silence between the lines.

I don’t know if I’ll send this.
